# Atom Framework Unit Tests

This repository includes unit tests for core features of the Atom Framework, ensuring key functionalities perform as expected.

### 1. **AFImportanceDiffusionUTest.cxxtest**
Tests the **importance diffusion** process, verifying correct propagation of attention values across nodes.

### 2. **AFRentCollectionUTest.cxxtest**
Validates the **rent collection** mechanism, ensuring resources are collected and distributed accurately among active nodes.

### 3. **ForgettingAgentUnitTest.cxxtest**
Checks the **Forgetting Agent**, confirming proper removal of low-importance nodes and retention of essential ones.

These tests ensure the robustness of importance diffusion, resource management, and memory handling in the framework.
